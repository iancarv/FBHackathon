## Dataset

Steam is the world's most popular PC Gaming hub. With a massive collection that includes everything from AAA blockbusters to small indie titles, great discovery tools can be super valuable for Steam. How can we make them better?

This dataset is a list of user behaviors, with columns: user-id, game-title, behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'purchase' and 'play'. The value indicates the degree to which the behavior was performed - in the case of 'purchase' the value is always 1, and in the case of 'play' the value represents the number of hours the user has played the game.
